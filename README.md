## About Project

that project is an application who allows users to add,share,edit and delete their events,
but before that the user need to add event with name and location, unfortunately we hav'nt sufficient time for adding some features, like photos, comentate photos...


## working with tools

## Laravel as backend

We use laravel as backend for fetching data, insert data and edit,delete data. Working with laravel for the first time seems to me hard especually with controlles and models and how you migrate data with the project, i took 4 weeks just for learned it.


## react as frontend

Also we used Reactjs library for javascript as frontend to the project, we inserted inside the project and we had defining some components like header,index,add,edit,listing... inside  resource/js
